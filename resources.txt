Sequence Numbers

All bytes in a TCP connection are numbered, beginning at a randomly chosen initial sequence number (ISN).
The SYN packets consume one sequence number, so actual data will begin at ISN+1.
The sequence number is the byte number of the first byte of data in the TCP packet sent (
also called a TCP segment).
The acknowledgement number is the sequence number of the next byte the receiver expects to receive.

The receiver ack'ing sequence number x acknowledges receipt of all data bytes less than (but not including) byte number x.

The sequence number is always valid.
The acknowledgement number is only valid when the ACK flag is one.
The only time the ACK flag is not set, that is,
the only time there is not a valid acknowledgement number in the TCP header, is during the first packet of connection set-up.
